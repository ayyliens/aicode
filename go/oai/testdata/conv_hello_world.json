{"role":"assistant","content":"Here is an example of how you can implement \"hello world\" in Scheme (Racket):\n\n```\n#lang racket ; Use the Racket language\n\n; Define a function to print \"hello world\"\n(define (hello-world)\n  (displayln \"Hello, world!\"))\n\n; Call the function to print \"hello world\"\n(hello-world)\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a Scheme (Racket) interpreter or save it in a `.rkt` file and run it with the Racket interpreter. When executed, it will print \"Hello, world!\" to the console."}

{"role":"assistant","content":"Here is the equivalent \"hello world\" implementation in Common Lisp using SBCL:\n\n```lisp\n(defun hello-world ()\n  (format t \"Hello, world!\"))\n\n(hello-world)\n```\n\nIn Common Lisp, you define functions using the `defun` form. The `hello-world` function is defined to print \"Hello, world!\" using the `format` function, with `t` as the first argument indicating that the output should go to the standard output stream. \n\nTo run this code, you can either load it in an interactive Lisp environment like Emacs + SLIME or save the code in a file with a `.lisp` extension and execute it with SBCL. When executed, it will print \"Hello, world!\" to the console."}

{"role":"assistant","content":"Here is the equivalent \"hello world\" implementation in Haskell:\n\n```haskell\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = putStrLn \"Hello, world!\"\n```\n\nIn Haskell, the entry point of a program is the `main` function, which has a type signature of `IO ()`. Inside the `main` function, we use the `putStrLn` function to print \"Hello, world!\" to the console.\n\nTo run this code, save it in a file with a `.hs` extension and then compile and execute it using the GHC compiler. Alternatively, you can run it in a Haskell interpreter, such as GHCi, and call the `main` function directly. When executed, it will print \"Hello, world!\" to the console."}
