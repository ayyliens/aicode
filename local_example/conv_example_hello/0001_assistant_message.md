Here is an example of how you can implement "hello world" in Scheme (Racket):

```
#lang racket ; Use the Racket language

; Define a function to print "hello world"
(define (hello-world)
  (displayln "Hello, world!"))

; Call the function to print "hello world"
(hello-world)
```

You can run this code in a Scheme (Racket) interpreter or save it in a `.rkt` file and run it with the Racket interpreter. When executed, it will print "Hello, world!" to the console.
